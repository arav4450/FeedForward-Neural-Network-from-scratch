Feed Forward Neural Network from scratch

This is an implementation of Feedforward Neural network from scratch using python and numpy.
Dataset used is “fashion mnist” and is loaded from tensorflow dataset
There are seven python files 
1.	Layer.py – used for creating a linear NN layer
2.	Model.py – actual neural network which consist of a collection of layers
3.	Exp_setup.py – sets up a model for training. Learning rate and optimizer are defined here
4.	Trainer.py – implements the training process
5.	Activations.py – different activation functions are defined here
6.	Optimizer.py – different optimizers are defined here
7.	Run_experiment.py – takes arguments from command line and run the experiment

  How to use?
1.	Create a new python environment(if required)
2.	Install tensorflow (for using dataset)
3.	Clone the Repository
4.	Go to Code folder
5.	Run the command “python run_experiment.py”. If required arguments can also be given.
